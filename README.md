## Hello there! 👋

I’m Gurudatt,
Software engineer based in Boston & MS CS student at Northeastern University.

I have experience in the Property & Casualty Insurance domain, specializing in .NET development.
An AI enthusiast, I’m especially interested in Natural Language Processing and Image Processing, and enjoy exploring how intelligent systems can solve real-world problems.

I build things end-to-end — from ideas to shipped features.
If there’s a problem, I enjoy designing, coding, breaking, and fixing it.

Tech: C#, .NET, SQL, Azure, Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Django

Always learning. Always building. 🚀
